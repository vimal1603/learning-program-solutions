Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem. Each recursive call reduces the problem size until a base case is reached, which ends the recursion.

Recursion simplifies problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems, such as calculating factorials, Fibonacci numbers, or future financial values based on repeated growth.
