Linear Search works by checking each element in the list one by one until it finds the target or reaches the end. Its best-case time complexity is O(1), which occurs if the target element is the very first item in the list. However, in most practical scenarios, the element is somewhere in the middle or at the end, making the average and worst-case time complexities O(n), where n is the number of elements.

Binary Search, on the other hand, works only on sorted data. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, significantly reducing the number of comparisons. The best case for binary search is also O(1), when the target happens to be exactly in the middle. In both average and worst cases, the time complexity is O(log n) due to this halving approach.

While linear search does not require any preprocessing or sorting, binary search requires the data to be sorted in advance. However, sorting can be done once and reused multiple times for faster repeated searches.

For an e-commerce platform, search functionality is a core component and must be highly optimized for performance. Users expect fast results when searching for products, even when dealing with tens of thousands of items.

Binary Search is more suitable in this context for several reasons:

High Performance Needs:
Since binary search operates in logarithmic time, it provides much faster search results compared to linear search, especially as the number of products grows. This performance gain becomes critical as the platform scales.

Sorted Data Availability:
In most e-commerce systems, product data is already organized or can be sorted by fields such as name, category, or price. This makes it feasible and practical to use binary search effectively.

Efficiency for Large Datasets:
With large product catalogs, linear search becomes inefficient and slow. Binary search, on the other hand, continues to perform well even as the dataset grows significantly.

Improved User Experience:
Faster search means quicker results for users, contributing to a smoother and more satisfying user experience, which is essential in e-commerce.

That said, linear search may still be applicable in scenarios where the dataset is small, dynamic, or frequently updated in a way that prevents efficient sorting. For example, temporary lists like search suggestions or dynamic filters may still benefit from linear search due to their small size or constantly changing content.
